# 2022 Midterm Directions
Inside of this repository you will find a brochure regarding the benefits of studying computer science.
Use the logo and information inside the brochure to build a 5 page website.

__* You do not need to include all of the brochure, just pick 5 sections to be your pages__

All of your pages should be built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  Adding additional effects with Javascript is optional.

All pages must include a header, navigation bar, at least one column, and a footer.
Header, navbar, and footer should be identical on all pages.
Please use the logo from within the brochure (included in the images folder) and a color scheme that will mesh with the logo.

## Your project must pass W3C validation
